first edit cast_c57_bamfiles.txt, then
python3.4 snp_stats2.py -MSF -p 20

the folders cast/ c57/ cast_57/ and c57_cast/ are expected to exist in the same folder (empty is fine)
output will be in gene_by_cells_cast_c57_reads.txt, and intermediary files in cast_c57/



afterwards this could be run for format conversion
python cellcounts_to_rpkmf.py -r splitcells_ensemblexcl_rpkms.txt --noNA gene_by_cells_cast_c57_reads.txt splitcells_allelehits.txt --rpkmf_genes



for dependencies, you can run
sudo pip3 install joblib
sudo pip3 install numpy



castsnps.txt and castsnps_alleles.txt are truncated (10k first lines) because of upload size limits
